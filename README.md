## Ideas for Capstone Project

### 1. Amazon Recommended Reviews
**Idea:** Use classification analysis to find better reviews for individual Amazon consumer.  
**Problem:** Not all product reviews are made equally for all audiences. With each consumer having different preferences, if we can identify what reviews the consumer finds helpful can we then send them additional reviews/reviewers who more closely align with their tastes?

### 2. Credit Card Default Predictions
**Idea:** Use classification analysis to identify level of risk for potential credit card clients.  
**Problem:** The probability of default can affect credit card companiesâ€™ revenue. Can we predict the estimated probability of default in order to assign interest rate, credit line, and/or denial of potential credit card applicants?

### 3. YouTube Spam Filter
**Idea:** Use classification analysis to proactively identify and flag potential spam comments on YouTube videos.  
**Problem:** Due to the high volume of comments left on YouTube on a regular basis, individual manual moderation of comments is unscalable and untenable. Can we design a model to predict the likelihood of spam comments based on previous spam characteristics to filter out (or moderate on a delay) these suspected bad actor comments?
